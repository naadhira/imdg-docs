= Dynamically Adding Data Structure Configuration on a Cluster
[[dynamically-adding-data-structure-configuration-on-a-cluster]]

Hazelcast can be configured in a declarative or
programmatic way; configuration must be completed before starting a
Hazelcast member and this configuration cannot be altered at runtime,
thus we refer to this as _static_ configuration.

It is possible to dynamically add configuration for certain data structures at
runtime; these can be added by invoking one of the `Config.add*Config` methods on
the `Config` object obtained from a running member's `HazelcastInstance.getConfig()` method.
For example:

[source,java]
----
include::{javasource}/DynamicConfiguration.java[tag=dynconf]
----

WARNING: You must invoke the `add*Config` method on the Hazelcast instance's configuration object to
add a configuration dynamically. In the above example, this is done with the
`instance.getConfig().addMapConfig(noBackupsMap);` line. This submits the map configuration dynamically
to all cluster members and also to members which join the cluster later.

Dynamic configuration elements must be fully configured before the invocation
of `add*Config` method: at that point, the configuration object is delivered
to every member of the cluster and added to each member's dynamic configuration,
so mutating the configuration object after the `add*Config` invocation does not have
an effect.

As dynamically added data structure configuration is propagated across all cluster
members, failures may occur due to conditions such as timeout and network partition.
The configuration propagation mechanism internally retries adding the configuration
whenever a membership change is detected. However if an exception is thrown from
`add*Config` method, the configuration may have been partially propagated to some
cluster members and adding the configuration should be retried by the user.

Adding a new dynamic configuration is supported for all `add*Config` methods except the following:

* `SplitBrainProtectionConfig`: A new split-brain protection configuration cannot be dynamically added but other
configuration can reference split-brain protections configured in the existing static configuration.
* `WanReplicationConfig`: A new WAN replication configuration cannot be dynamically
added, however existing static ones can be referenced from other configurations,
e.g., a new dynamic `MapConfig` may include a `WanReplicationRef` to a statically
configured WAN replication.
* `ListenerConfig`: Listeners can be instead added at runtime via other API such as
`HazelcastInstance.getCluster().addMembershipListener` and
`HazelcastInstance.getPartitionService().addMigrationListener`.

Keep in mind that this feature also works for Hazelcast Java clients.
See the following example:

[source,java]
----
HazelcastInstance client = HazelcastClient.newHazelcastClient();
MapConfig mCfg = new MapConfig("test");
mCfg.setTimeToLiveSeconds(15);
client.getConfig().addMapConfig(mCfg);
HazelcastClient.shutdownAll();
----

NOTE: If your cluster has data structures with configurations added during runtime,
those configurations are lost when a cluster restart occurs due to any reason since
they are not persisted. This will be improved in future Hazelcast IMDG releases.

== Handling Configuration Conflicts

Attempting to add a dynamic configuration, when a static configuration for
the same element already exists, throws `InvalidConfigurationException`. For example,
assuming we start a member with the following fragment in `hazelcast.xml` configuration:

[source,xml]
----
<hazelcast>
    ...
    <map name="sessions">
        ...
    </map>
    ...
</hazelcast>
----

Then adding a dynamic configuration for a map with the name `sessions` throws
a `InvalidConfigurationException`:

[source,java]
----
HazelcastInstance instance = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance();

MapConfig sessionsMapConfig = new MapConfig("sessions");

// this will throw ConfigurationException:
instance.getConfig().addMapConfig(sessionsMapConfig);
----

When attempting to add dynamic configuration for an element for which dynamic
configuration has already been added, then if a configuration conflict is detected
a `InvalidConfigurationException` is thrown. For example:

[source,java]
----
HazelcastInstance instance = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance();

MapConfig sessionsMapConfig = new MapConfig("sessions").setBackupCount(0);
instance.getConfig().addMapConfig(sessionsMapConfig);

MapConfig sessionsWithBackup = new MapConfig("sessions").setBackupCount(1);
// throws ConfigurationException because the new MapConfig conflicts with existing one
instance.getConfig().addMapConfig(sessionsWithBackup);

MapConfig sessionsWithoutBackup = new MapConfig("sessions").setBackupCount(0);
// does not throw exception: new dynamic config is equal to existing dynamic config of same name
instance.getConfig().addMapConfig(sessionsWithoutBackup);
----

== Dynamic Data Structure Configuration and User Customizations

Dynamically added data structure configuration may reference
user customizations, such as a user-provided `MapLoader` implementation referenced
by a `MapConfig`. User customizations can be usually configured using either of the following:

* by specifying a class or factory class name, e.g., `MapStoreConfig.setClassName`, and letting the
Hazelcast members instantiate the object
* by providing an existing instance, e.g., `MapStoreConfig.setImplementation`.

When dynamically adding new a data structure configuration with user customizations,
take the following considerations into account:

* For the user customizations submitted as a class name or factory class name, the referenced
classes are resolved  lazily. Therefore, they should be either already on each member's local
classpath or resolvable via xref:clusters:deploying-code-on-member.adoc[user code deployment].
* When the user customizations are submitted as instances (or similarly factory instances),
the instances themselves have to be serializable. This is because the entire configuration needs
to be sent over the network to all cluster members, and their classes have to be available
on each member's local classpath.
